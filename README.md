There are three files in this repo:
 - run_analysis.R
 - summaryData.csv
 - CodeBook.md

run_analysis.R is an R script that reads raw data from the UCI HAR Dataset, tidies and summarizes the data, and outputs that summary to summaryData.csv

CodeBook.md further describes the tidying process and provides variable names
